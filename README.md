# HANGMAN

This project was completed in April 2021 and it was used to learn python. The aim was to do a hangman game with random cities and where the user could save the scrore on a csv file.


## How to play

- You have to guess the hidden word before the hangman fully appears. Words are only coutries.
- First try guessing by writing letter. Do not repeat letters.
- If you think you know the word, try to guess it, but be careful, you only have one chance!
- Finally, have fun!
- Insert "quit" in "Your guess:" to end the game.
